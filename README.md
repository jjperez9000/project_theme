# project_theme

This is a WIP application based around [this](https://www.themesystem.com) idea by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley.

It's purpose will be to have the same use and section types as the notebook itself does, it will just also be on my computer 
so that I don't have to use a pen, since I like the concept, I just despise writing with a pen.
