# project_theme

This is a an application based around [this](https://www.themesystem.com) idea by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley.

Its purpose is for all around journaling and life tracking. It's got all of the same page types that are used by the theme system journal (goals, general writing, and idea sketching). 

I'ts implemented entirely in Swift using Core Data as the means of storing all of the user's information. 

Here's a video of the app in action: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvn1ptncd2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvn1ptncd2k)
